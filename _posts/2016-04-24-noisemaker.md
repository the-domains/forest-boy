Noisemaker is the partnership between actor/writer Scott Gilmour and composer Claire McKenzie. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7afaf8cc-47ea-4e5a-9082-e3c5acb3f9a2.jpg)

Both graduates of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, they share a desire to create innovative, imaginative work that challenges the expectations of musical theatre. Since graduating the pair have worked within the UK and internationally with companies including The National Theatre of Scotland, The Royal Lyceum, BBC, Chichester Festival Theatre, Citizens Theatre, Channel 4, Dundee Rep, Clerkenwell Films, The Roundhouse, Merry-Go-Round Playhouse (NYC) and the Singapore School of the Arts.

Noisemaker was formed after the success of Claire and Scott's first piece, FreakShow, an immersive song cycle set within a Victorian sideshow. FreakShow played at The Arches, Glasgow, before transferring to The Roundhouse, London, and then to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where it was awarded the Scottish Daily Mail Drama Award. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/efcfb2e1-0a07-4654-90ca-2f8ee8bd040c.jpg)

In 2013, Noisemaker began developing Forest Boy with the MA Musical Theatre programme at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Forest Boy opened alongside FreakShow at the Edinburgh Fringe then transferred to the Arcola Theatre in London. Forest Boy was awarded the S&S Award in 2013, which granted the show inital development time and support to allow it to grow into a full scale piece. 

The Girl Who was commissioned by RCS as a new piece for their Edinburgh Fringe Season 2014\. Inspired by the iconic "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure" books, The Girl Who is the world's first multi-path musical. Following the story of Anna, a young girl searching for her parents, the show places the audience in charge of the character's decisions; giving them complete control of Anna's story. With 128 possible versions of the show, all visiting different worlds, songs and characters, every performance is unique. Claire and Scott recently confirmed that The Girl Who will move to New York later this year to undergo development with Merry-Go-Round Playhouse, in preparation for a production and state tour early next year.

Their latest piece, Little Red and the Wolf, was commissioned by Dundee Rep for it's Spring Season this year and is currently in rehearsal with Scott directing and Claire as musical director. It opened to huge critical aclaim at Dundee Rep in March 2016 and is in discussions to go out on tour later this year. [http://www.dundeerep.co.uk/event/littleredandthewolf][0]
