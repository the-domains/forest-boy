In September 2011, a boy appeared in Berlin claiming to have lived in the forest with his father for the past five years. He said his name was Ray and had no memory of his past - only that he travelled to Berlin following the death of his father in the woods. What followed were nine months of speculation, police enquiry and a global media frenzy, as the mystery of the Forest Boy was slowly unravelled...

Based on an incredible true story of a boy who captured the world's attention, Forest Boy is a modern-day fairytale of lies, growing up and, above all, imagination.

## DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 

In 2013, Claire and Scott were approached by The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland to develop a new piece of musical theatre for the MA Musical Theatre programme. They'd been following the story of "Forest Boy Ray" online and used it as a the stimulus for an inital workshop production of Forest Boy. The show opened at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2013 as a co-production between the Conservatoire and Noisemaker.

Following a successful run, Forest Boy transferred to the Arcola Theatre in London as part of the EH to E8 Festival where it was awarded the S&S Award for Best New Musical. The award allowed the show to undergo further development into a full scale musical and resulted in a final showcase production at the St James Theatre in London, 2015\. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5a77d5086f28995a767d90658f9ea677a222bd0a.jpg)

Now three years on, and lots of paper later, Claire and Scott are delighted to be presenting Forest Boy at this years' New York Musical Festival.
